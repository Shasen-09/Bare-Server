TEST: Invalid JSON
RESULT: 
Request returned 400 Bad Request.
Server did not crash.
Global error handler caught the JSON parsing error.
LOG:
tructured JSON log with timestamp, level, path, method, and status.
Error message was clear but did not indicate the error source (parser vs controller).
No request body or stack trace in production logs, making deep debugging harder.
